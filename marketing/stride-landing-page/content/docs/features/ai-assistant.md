Nia: "I can help you find some great resources! Have you checked the Psychology space on Stride Campus? There are usually study guides and notes shared there. You could also upload your own notes to earn credits while helping other students. What specific topics are you covering?"
```

**Writing Help**
```
You: "I have to write a 5-page essay on climate change but I don't know where to start."

Nia: "Let's break this down! First, what's your specific angle or focus? Are you looking at causes, effects, solutions, or a particular aspect? Once we narrow that down, I can help you create an outline and find some solid sources to get you started."
